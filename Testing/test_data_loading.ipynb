    "- The difference between small language model and large language model is in its training dataset, the transformer architecture remains same. It sole purpose is to pretrain language model for specific task whereas LLM can do multiple tasks. Thereby a good quality dataset is important for our SLM to capture the grammer and context of a sentence and the task."
